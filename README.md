# hts-irradiation
A graphical user interface for data acquisition and hardware control of the cryogenic neutron/ion irradiation facilities at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center. 

The repository also includes a set of python libraries for data processing, specifically:

* Loading, pre-processing, and fitting of Ic and Tc measurement data
* Fluence and dpa calculations, as well as a pysrim setup to compute number of frenkel pairs and volumetric power deposition as a function of depth in a coated conductor.
